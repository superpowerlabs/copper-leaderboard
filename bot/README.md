## Prerequisites

You'll need a Discord bot who has the ability to post in a channel in your Discord server.

First, you need a Discord server where you have permission to add a Bot. It's free and easy to create your own Discord server.

Once you have a server you can use, grab the channel ID following the instructions at this Discord support article. You'll enable developer mode, which will allow you to easily copy the channel ID from the Discord app - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-.

Next, create a New Application on the Discord developer portal by clicking the button in the top right corner at https://discord.com/developers/applications.

Give your application a name.~~~~

Click into the Bot menu item. You can name your bot and give it an avatar, but the only requirement is that you copy the Bot token:

Click into the OAuth2 menu item. Give your application the bot scope:

Then, in the next section, give your bot the Send Messages permission under Text Permissions:

Now you're ready to authenticate your bot to your server - copy the OAuth URL from the scopes box and open it in your browser. You'll be asked to give permission to the bot to enter your server.

Once the bot is in your server, ensure you have the following two values and you are ready to deploy or run your script:

- **botToken** i.e `SBI1MDI0NzUyNDQ3NzgyOTEz.YF36LQ.Sw-rczOfalK0lVzuW8vBjjcnsy0`
- **channelId** i.e. `814900494928445450`

## Run locally or on a remote machine

You can run this script locally by pulling the repo to your local machine.

First, install the dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`.

Then copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and replace the example values with your own.

```
$ npm run start
```

If you put it on a remote server, use a process manager. We suggests [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

After installing it, you can run to launch the app with pm2
```
./start.sh
```
